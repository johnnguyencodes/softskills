I was a completely different person before LearningFuze.

</br>

##### Graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in Asian American Studies

- It's the study of the historical, social, and political factors that shapes the formation of Asian American communities
- Super involved in student organizations and student government
- Started a poetry and spoken word group which taught me how powerful storytelling can be

</br>

##### I lived in New Orleans for from 2008 to 2010

- Working my dream job as a community organizer for the Vietnamese American community, where I worked with high school youth to become more civically engaged in the community
- But doing non-profit work in a socially disadvantaged community <strong>burned me out</strong>
- Realizing that my dream job was not my dream job <u>broke my heart</u>

</br>

##### When I moved back to California in 2010, I couldn't get a job with my degree

</br>

##### Over the next 10 years:

- My first job was a part-time after school teacher for second graders at $11/hr.
- Second job was an office manager at a medical clinic. $14/hr - $17/hr
- Third job was the inventory manager at a retail store. $15
- Fourth job was doing data entry at an interior design company for four years. $15/hr to $17/hr.

> No matter how well I did at my jobs (and I was really good at it), I was frustrated for feeling stuck and making so little money in my 30s. I had so much social anxiety from comparing myself so much to my friends that I would have panic attacks from the thought of even hanging out with my friends, so I shut myself in and talked to nobody outside of work. I knew I was smart and that somewhere in side of me, I had potential, but I didn't know what to do to let it out. I had no hope. Life really sucked.

> But what I learned throughout this time is the importance of humility, kindness, empathy, and great customer experience. Even though my jobs at the time were not related to tech, these experiences will help me become a better web developer through my soft skills.

And then I learned about LearningFuze. I quit my job, and right before my cohort started (and the pandemic happened).
