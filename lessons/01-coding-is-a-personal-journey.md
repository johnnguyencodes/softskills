##### Assumption:

The job market is saturated, how do I stand out when everybody has learned the same tech stack as me?

##### My response:

Your approach to the code, how you overcome your challenges, and the way you work with others is uniquely your own.

##### The objective of this presentation:

I want to talk about my personal journey through my code. I hope sharing my perspective, especially as a someone who manages other junior web developers, can help you reframe this perspective.

> Developing your soft skills will make you stand out. LearningFuze is the perfect place to practice.
