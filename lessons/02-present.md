##### At home, I work on hobby projects:

- I'm rebuilding my personal website using Remix and Tailwind
- To increase my productivity, I'm learning Vim so I can throw away my mouse
- I'm learning the ISRT keyboard layout for those sweet finger rolls when typing

> If I could, I would code all day non-stop. There's so much for me to learn, and I want to learn it all! (yes, even including data structures and algorithms)

</br>

##### When I'm not coding:

- I want to learn how to be a mountaineer so I can go hike and camp in the snow up in the mountains
- Learning boxing, kickboxing
- I want to get back into the gym
- <strong><u>I love dancing</u></strong>
- Recovering plant addict
