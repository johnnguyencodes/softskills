So let's take a step back and think about LearningFuze as a whole.

If you are in the full-immersion program, you spend over 3 months learning how to code. Although you have learned and accomplished so much, it's still something very recent.

In addition to what you learned in the curriculum, what else will you bring to the table when you apply for jobs?

<strong>Soft Skills</strong>.

As a developer, these are some important soft skills to have:

- Being able to explain complex technical ideas to non-technical people
- Managing expectations
- Listening and asking questions
- Being able to rally your team
- Empathizing with and/or think like your customers/users
- Identifying and solving problems
- Being a team player and having a positive attitude
- Being adaptable to changing requirements
- Reporting to your stakeholders
  - and so much more (use Google to find others)

This is a question I ask when I interview candidates:

<i>How do you think your experience as the < <strong>Position</strong> > at < <strong>Company</strong> > can help you become a better developer?</i>

When I was first writing my resume, I had such a hard time figuring out what tech/developer-related accomplishments I can highlight. But this is a very narrow way of thinking.

> Based on everything you learned about coding during the bootcamp and your experiences communicating with your peers, instructors, and staff at LearningFuze, what are some experiences you've learned in your previous jobs that could help you become a better communicator? Highlight these accomplishments in your resume.

For me, I have a lifetime's worth of experiences to pull from to highlight my soft skills.

- Directing a cultural stage production involving over 100 cast members for the Vietnamese Student Association at UC Irvine
- The care and attention I gave to each of my second graders as an after school teacher
- How I listened to my patients and worked with them to get the insurance coverage to pay for their medical procedures as the office manager at the medical clinic
- The importance of checking my work when pricing merchandise as the inventory manager at my retail job
- The ability to collect, organize, and process large amounts of data manually as a data entry specialist

Everything I've learned on the job at my previous companies have shaped me in becoming the developer and manager I am at Zymo Research, and looking back on it now, I don't regret any of it.

> When I interviewed for my first job, I told companies, "The unfair advantage I have over other candidates applying for this position is that I bring a lifetime's worth of leadership experience with me to the table."
