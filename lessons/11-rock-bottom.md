##### Learning how to code is hard. Learning how to talk about the code is even harder.

- Junior side was very tough for me
- I'm usually one of the last students to turn my assignments in
- I was feeling very overwhelmed

</br>

##### Soft Skill: Reaching out to an instructor and asking for help.

- But this wasn't about a specific assignment. I was asking for help for me, for myself, for how I feel about my progress at LearningFuze
- A week into senior side, I messaged my instructor asking if I could repeat junior side

</br>

##### Soft Skills: Explaining the situation, Identifying the Solution

- I was connected with Monique Cunningham, she was the Program Coordinator at LFZ, and I explained why I wanted to repeat junior side (thankfully I did a really poor job at it)
- She told me that there the assignments I turned in were complete, my instructor said there is no reason why I needed to repeat junior side
- She helped me identify the root issue I was facing: <strong>I wasn't comfortable with NOT knowing everything</strong>

</br>

> The ability to feel comfortable with not knowing everything is very important, especially in an accelerated learning environment like a bootcamp. If you can learn to embrace this feeling and only focus on what you need to know to get the job done, you can focus on producing instead of feeling stuck and overwhelmed.

</br>

##### Soft Skills: Talking about the code. Talking to a "senior developer" really helped out

- I'm not sure if LearningFuze does this anymore, but Monique assigned a TA as my tutor that would meet with me a few times a week for two weeks (Thanks Kris Ringler!!)
- We did coding problems together and what really helped me is that he saw how I approached a problem
- My obstacle was that, in my assignments, I didn't know if I was going to go down a rabbit hole that led me no where that would only "waste my time"

> "A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenge, and don't see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth."

- He helped show me what it was like to approach a problem his way where, instead of just starting to code in any direction and just hope for the best, he showed me how he approached a problem strategically starting at a higher level.
  - He would read the problem over a couple times to <strong>understand</strong> what it was asking.
  - He would <strong>plan out the overall steps</strong> he would take to solve the problem.
  - And then he would start <strong>solving the problem according to his plan</strong>, making adjustments to his plan as needed.

</br>

##### As I continued onto Senior Side, I started noticing patterns with my projects, especially with CRUD applications

- I was going into less rabbit holes and started making better decisions about my code.
- When I started to recognize coding patterns and can make good predictions about what my next steps are, this is when coding became <strong>enjoyable and fun</strong>
