Let's fast forward a bit.

</br>

##### How did I do on my first mock interview?

- I bombed it (Looking back on this, it's totally ok)

##### How did I do on my group senior final project presentation?

- I loved working on it and am proud of my contributions
- But presenting my work? I bombed it (Looking back on this, it's totally okay too)

</br>

But hey, guess what?

# ðŸ¥³ I graduated!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

> This is where the real program starts. And where your personal journey really begins.

</br>

> The instructors are no longer focused on you, they have to start teaching their next class (although they are still available as resource!). This is where self-motivation, keeping yourself on track, and leveraging Andreana and the Career Services department becomes key to your success.

</br>

At this point, I loved coding but I was having a hard time talking about it to others.

Remember the social anxiety that prevented me from talking to my friends? It was difficult for me to speak clearly, which caused my self-confidence to tank, which makes me nervous when I talk to others causing me to stumble over my words, etc etc etc.

There are things I need to address about myself first outside of the code in order for me to become a good developer.

Who knew coding can get so personal??

##### Soft Skills: Building relationships with other people (i.e. networking in disguise)

</br>

Cassandra Cheung, the Career Services Coordinator at the time, was a HUGE help. Before I could start applying for jobs, I had to get my resume and LinkedIn profile approved by her.

She look over my resume and my LinkedIn profile, and I really enjoyed talking to her, and we became really good friends. I felt like I can confide in her and trust in her. She spent a lot of her own time with me and I appreciated that so much.

She also coordinated online game nights where I met students from cohorts before me. And we would casually talk about our job search, how things were going with our interviews, showing off the portfolio websites and cool projects we built.

Through these game nights, I met another person, Judy Chiang, who did both the web development and the UI/UX curricula at LearningFuze. We also talked and through her, she helped make me realize something.

That although I am a below-average communicator and above-average word stumbler, there is something that was unique about me. She told me, "It's really easy talking to you."

I was like, "What."

She was like, "Yeah. Through the way you carry yourself, you have a very approachable personality."

And that just flipped a big switch in my head.

> I learned that it's ok to not be a perfect communicator. A lot of my nervousness about the imperfectness of how I communicate went away. For me, as long as I can get across my main message, that's good enough in my book.

And this helped me focus not on how I was talking, but the ideas I was trying to convey.
