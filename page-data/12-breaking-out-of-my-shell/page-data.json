Before I could start applying for jobs, I had to get my resume and LinkedIn profile approved by her.</p>\n<p>She look over my resume and my LinkedIn profile, and I really enjoyed talking to her, and we became really good friends. I felt like I can confide in her and trust in her. She spent a lot of her own time with me and I appreciated that so much.</p>\n<p>She also coordinated online game nights where I met students from cohorts before me. And we would casually talk about our job search, how things were going with our interviews, showing off the portfolio websites and cool projects we built.</p>\n<p>Through these game nights, I met another person, Judy Chiang, who did both the web development and the UI/UX curricula at LearningFuze. We also talked and through her, she helped make me realize something.</p>\n<p>That although I am a below-average communicator and above-average word stumbler, there is something that was unique about me. She told me, \"It's really easy talking to you.\"</p>\n<p>I was like, \"What.\"</p>\n<p>She was like, \"Yeah. Through the way you carry yourself, you have a very approachable personality.\"</p>\n<p>And that just flipped a big switch in my head.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I learned that it's ok to not be a perfect communicator. A lot of my nervousness about the imperfectness of how I communicate went away. For me, as long as I can get across my main message, that's good enough in my book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this helped me focus not on how I was talking, but the ideas I was trying to convey.</p>\n<h5 id=\"\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\" permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h5>","frontmatter":{"path":"/12-breaking-out-of-my-shell","title":"Breaking out of my shell","order":"2B","section":"Learning how to tell my story"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/01-coding-is-a-personal-journey","title":"Coding is a personal journey"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1B","path":"/02-present","title":"Who I am"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1C","path":"/03-past","title":"Who I was"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/11-rock-bottom","title":"Climbing out from the bottom"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/12-breaking-out-of-my-shell","title":"Breaking out of my shell"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/13-you-are-more-than-your-code","title":"Resume tips to highlight your soft skills"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/21-career-services-is-worth-its-weight-in-gold","title":"Career Services is worth its weight in gold"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/22-developing-my-soft-skills-through-building-relationships","title":"Developing my soft skills through building relationships"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3C","path":"/22-getting-interviews","title":"Leverage career services to get your interviews"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/31-developing-your-personal-brand","title":"Developing your personal brand"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/32-your-pitch-and-talking-about-your-projects","title":"Your pitch and talking tech"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/32-communicating-during-the-coding-session","title":"Communicating during the coding session"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
